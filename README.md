![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/davidalger/php.svg?label=Docker%20Pulls)

## Supported Tags

Images are built and tagged using both stable and version specific tags to support pinning downstream builds to latest available for `7.4` or to a specific version such as `7.4.16`. Please reference the [image repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/davidalger/php) on Docker Hub for a complete list of available tags. Builds are automatically run on the 1st of each month and/or when changes are pushed to the master branch of this repository.

* `8.1`, `8.1-loaders`, `8.1-fpm`, `8.1-fpm-loaders`
* `8.0`, `8.0-loaders`, `8.0-fpm`, `8.0-fpm-loaders`
* `7.4`, `7.4-loaders`, `7.4-fpm`, `7.4-fpm-loaders`
* `7.3`, `7.3-loaders`, `7.3-fpm`, `7.3-fpm-loaders`
* `7.2`, `7.2-loaders`, `7.2-fpm`, `7.2-fpm-loaders`

The `-loaders` suffix indicates the image includes both Source Guardian and IonCube loaders. These should only be used when encoded PHP is present in a project.

Images for older versions of PHP may be available (see Docker Hub for available tags) but they are no longer actively maintained.
